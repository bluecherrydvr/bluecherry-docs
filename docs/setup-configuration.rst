Recording schedules

**Click on user's Full Name. Note: To prevent you from accidently removing yourself it is not possible for you to remove the account you are logged in as.**

.. image:: img/edit-user.png

**You can the option to change any of the fields above, including the password. You can also add specific restrictions on what the user has access to. The notes section lets you add user specific notes.**

Restrict cameras per user
-------------------------

**Restricting access on a per-user basis**

.. image:: img/user-list.png

From the ‘Users’ section click on any of the names in the list. For this example, we are going to pick on Joe Blow, who we do not trust.

.. image:: img/userdetail.png

**Click ‘Edit access list’**

.. image:: img/camera-permissions.png

**By default Joe Blow has access to all cameras. We do not want him to have access to cameras, simply click on the camera name. This will change the color of the camera from green (full access) to red (no access). Joe Blow will not see the camera in the available video devices, or in the event / search area. Changes are applied instantly.
**

System logs
-----------

**Select ‘System Log’ from the left menu bar **
.. image:: img/systemlog-select.png

**This log shows everything that has been logged to /var/log/bluecherry.log and to /var/lib/bluecherry/www-error.log
Note: These logs is randomly rotated, so it will likely not contain all of the logs since the server has started.**

Admin password reset procedure
------------------------------

In case you’ve lost or forgot Bluecherry server Admin password, you can change it to default in database.

``mysql -u bluecherry -p bluecherry -e "update Users set password='b22dec1d6cfa580962f3a3796a5dc6b3', salt='1234' where username='Admin';"``


This resets the login to Admin and the password to bluecherry
